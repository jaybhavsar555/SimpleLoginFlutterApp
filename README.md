## 🛠️ Troubleshooting  
- **App crashes on login?** Ensure your `firebase_options.dart` is correctly configured.  
- **Error: Missing google-services.json?** Download it from Firebase Console and place it in `android/app/`.  
- **White screen on launch?** Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get` and restart.
